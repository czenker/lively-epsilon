= Lively Epsilon Documenation

Lively Epsilon is a plugin framework for https://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/[Empty Epsilon(EE)] that
aims to fill the space with artificial life.

If you are into writing missions this framework might help you create an intriguing universe full of life
that your crew will be eager to explore. You as a Game Master can focus on your plot lines without needing
to entertain all stations at all times.

Think about flying through the galaxy and watching traders ship goods from one station to another,
law-enforcement ships scanning ships, stations answering docking requests of NPCs or just two pilots
having a chat through comms. There is a lot to explore in that galaxy.
